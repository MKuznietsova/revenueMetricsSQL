Revenue metrics analysis

The goal was to create an insightful dashboard to present to the product management team.
Functional: The dashboard includes slicers by age category, month of engagement, and user's language. It allows to follow revenue metrics by timeline and highlight key factors influencing revenue dynamics

The project included:
- merging of two separate tables in SQL
- calculation of the previous and next month after payment, which further allows us to see whether the current month is the last/first month of payment and calculate new users, the number of churned, etc.
- calculation of the metrics in SQL: ARPPU, MRR, LT, LTV, Expansion MRR, Contraction MRR, New paying users, Churned users, Churned Revenue
- creating dashboard in Tableau https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maria.kuznietsova/viz/Book1_17371453435850/REVENUEMETRICSDASHBOARD?publish=yes
